A plugin to generate Swift constants for your String Catalogs.

## Motivation

Hardcoding localized strings in your code and then having the compiler automatically extract them into the Strings Catalog (or legacy .strings files) works great on smaller projects, but over time you will often find that this approach doesn't scale well.

You usually find yourself compromising on either code quality, translator comments or boilerplate code from having to define your own constants, but it doesn't have to be this way!

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @Query var items: [Item]

    var body: some View {
        List {
            Section {
                ForEach(items) { item in
                    ItemView(item)
                }
            } footer: {
                Text(.localizable(.footerText(items.count)))
            }
        }
        .navigationTitle(.localizable(.contentViewTitle))
    }
}
```

XCStrings Tool aims to extend your localization experience so that you don't have to compromise anything. It does this by using your Strings Catalog as a source for generating elegant Swift code that you can reference directly within the rest of your project.

## Getting Started

XCStrings Tool is a Swift Package Plugin that can integrate directly into Xcode and Swift Package targets that contain Strings Catalog (.xcstrings) files.
